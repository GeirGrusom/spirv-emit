# spirv-emit
SPIR-V bytecode emitter

This project aims to provide facilities for emitting SPIR-V byte code 
for Vulkan (glNext) or OpenCL.

This should allow developers to easily create byte code generators 
for Vulkan in order to use something like Linq-To-Vulkan for
generating shaders without going through GLSL. It is intended to allow
developers to emit CIL datatypes int the generated byte code.

It should also allow inspecting binaries, but emitting will be the
priority.
